A full-width container adjusts all of its pixels to take up the available space on the screen, so this is more flexible than a fixed-one.</td>

      <td>In RWDs, rows give columns a place to exist. Rows and columns go hand in hand, and you can wrap columns in a row. It is also useful for putting constraints on elements horizontally.</td>
